# Level Resetting

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/fIZ9m7A1pUA) learn how to simply allow player to "Play Again" by clicking a button. 

The video and this repository use a [framework implemented earlier](https://youtu.be/UoiuKeyGjc8) that manage animations between scenes. 

This repository mainly is focused on using the `SceneTransitioner` which simply wraps the `SceneManager` and provides transitions as defined as concrete implementations of `AbstractSceneTransitionScriptableObject`. This allows a much smoother transition from "end of level" to "beginning of level", however in the `DemoUI.cs` you can see commented code that is the barebones implementation using `SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync`.
